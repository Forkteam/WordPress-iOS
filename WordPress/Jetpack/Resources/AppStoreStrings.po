"When you’re creating a new site and entering the domain name, you should now see a more accurate error message if you try to use non-English characters that aren’t letters or numbers. We also tweaked the upload error text in media upload blocks.\n"

"Not sure if you’re looking at an image or a GIF in your Image block? No need to wonder anymore—animated GIFs now come with a GIF badge.\n"

"- Good news for all those orphan comments out there—we squashed a bug where comment replies got lost after their parent comments were unapproved.\n"
"- When you switch between sites on an iPad, you won’t switch between sidebar nav items, too. You’ll be looking at the same menu item you left on the previous site.\n"
"- Block setting changes to ordered lists now appear in the editor, not just in Preview.\n"
"- We fixed a keyboard issue in the WP.com account creation process. If you start entering a magic link password and change your mind, you can dismiss the keyboard and move on with your day.\n"
