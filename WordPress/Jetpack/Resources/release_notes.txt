We updated Comment Notifications with a spiffy new look and feel. (You might recognize it from My Site Comments!) The Quick Start design in your site menu and dashboard is rocking a new look, too.

When you’re creating a new site and entering the domain name, you should now see a more accurate error message if you try to use non-English characters that aren’t letters or numbers. We also tweaked the upload error text in media upload blocks.

Not sure if you’re looking at an image or a GIF in your Image block? No need to wonder anymore—animated GIFs now come with a GIF badge.

We also made a few bug fixes while we were under the hood.

- Good news for all those orphan comments out there—we squashed a bug where comment replies got lost after their parent comments were unapproved.
- When you switch between sites on an iPad, you won’t switch between sidebar nav items, too. You’ll be looking at the same menu item you left on the previous site.
- Block setting changes to ordered lists now appear in the editor, not just in Preview.
- We fixed a keyboard issue in the WP.com account creation process. If you start entering a magic link password and change your mind, you can dismiss the keyboard and move on with your day.
