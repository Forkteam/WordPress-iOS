Big news, site fans—your My Site screen just got better. You’ll now see two new tabs you can switch between: Site Menu and Home.

The Home tab also contains handy cards with more information about your site, including drafts, scheduled posts, and today’s stats. Or, if you’re in a hurry, you can easily head over to another section of the app.

We’re all about clear communication. That’s why we’ve added new error text to the photo upload process, just in case you try to upload a photo from your device without giving the app photo permission first.

Finally, when in-app notices pop up, they now fade out more smoothly when you don’t need them anymore. Exit stage left.
